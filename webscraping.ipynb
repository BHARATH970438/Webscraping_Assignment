    "- **** Text pattern matching: This method uses regular expressions to extract data from web pages. Regular expressions are a powerful tool that can be used to match specific patterns of text.\n",
    "- **** HTTP programming: This method involves using the HTTP protocol to request data from a web server. The data that is returned by the web server can then be parsed and extracted.\n",
    "- **** HTML parsing: This method involves parsing the HTML code of a web page to extract data. HTML parsing is a complex task, but there are many libraries and tools that can help with this process.\n",
    "- **** DOM parsing: This method involves parsing the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page to extract data. The DOM is a tree-like representation of the HTML code of a web page. DOM parsing is a more powerful approach than HTML parsing, but it is also more complex.\n"
